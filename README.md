# Pokeweb
Pokeweb is a javascript study, created to better understand how it works, how it communicate with json and APIs

!Important!
To search a pokemon, write on lower case, or use its code without the '#'.
The search is focus based, so for it to work, you need to click out or use tab.
( it was a requisite on this exercice )


To start the pokedex, click on it, it will open.
To close pokedex, click on it's tab, it will restart.

the "estou com sorte" find a random pokemon then saves it on a list so it wont show it again.
this list has persistence, so to reset it, you need to clean cash or to find all random pokemons, 
so it will start again from begining. ( the random pokemon go from 1 to 893, but you can acess the others
with search or next button )
